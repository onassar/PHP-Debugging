PHP-Debugging

While not particularly exciting, this collection of functions have proved
invaluable to me during development. Their focus is on shorthanded output of
variables, and exiting the current flow.

I thought about showing examples here, but they all pretty much speak for
themselves. Just call the function with a parameter, and see what happens :)
